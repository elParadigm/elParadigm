# Hi, I'm elParadigm 👋

I'm a computer science student at ISIMG with a strong interest in systems programming, developer tooling, and clean design. I enjoy building small, purposeful tools — especially in C++ and Go — and I'm always exploring ways to improve usability and performance on Linux.

### 🚀 Current Focus
- Building CLI tools with Go and Bubble Tea  
- Exploring systems-level programming with C++  
- Improving my knowledge in multivariable calculus and algorithms  
- Experimenting with design workflows using Photoshop

### 🧠 Projects & Interests
- **CLI Development** – Tools that improve developer experience on Linux  
- **Competitive Programming** – Active member of CPC ISIMG  
- **Design & UI** – Exploring minimal and clean visual identities for projects

### 📌 Goals
- Build reliable, maintainable software with good UX  
- Contribute to open source and collaborate on meaningful projects  
- Land a solid internship in software engineering or dev tooling
